San Francisco has a lot of amazing green spaces and community organizations working to build solidarity and climate resilience.

Many of them welcome volunteers regularly. These volunteer events are a great way to get outside, meet people, get involved in a specific community, and learn more about local ecology.

This list below is an overview of regularly volunteering events I know about here in the city. It's very unofficial.

**For each of the events below check on their official organization website before going.** Most require an RSVP, and many are subject to cancellation for inclement weather (sometimes rain, sometimes wind).

If you have any edits to this list please let me know! Email me at the address in the footer of the website or submit a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/hartsick/christa.town).

Also thanks to Garden for the Environment's [Get Up!](https://www.gardenfortheenvironment.org/getup) staff and program for introducing me to most of these. ilu
