Hi, I'm Christa Hartsock.

- professional things -

I’m currently working as a software engineer and UX researcher on a consulting basis through my company topographic LLC. I'm available for work on interesting projects that move toward a better world—if you have something you'd like to talk about working on together, let's chat (email: christa at topographic.llc).

In the recent past I've worked as:

* a backend software engineer at [Meedan](https://meedan.com/), a non-profit working globally to address misinformation
* a consulting engineer at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), the US federal government's technology and design consultancy
* an engineering manager, software engineer, and engineering lead at [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org), working to improve access to criminal record relief as part of [Clear My Record](https://www.codeforamerica.org/programs/clear-my-record), and help ease the burden of getting safety net benefits through the [Integrated Benefits Initiative](https://www.govtech.com/civic/code-for-americas-integrated-benefits-initiative-expands-to-five-states.html) and [GetCalFresh](https://demo.getcalfresh.org).

Prior to working with government, I've worked as an engineer at the agile consultancy Pivotal Labs (RIP) and at another small product consultancy (also RIP); as a studio manager at [Peter Rose and Partners](https://roseandpartners.com/), an architecture and urban design firm; as a travel guide writer in Barcelona, on a variety of cleanup crews; in many ice cream shops; and a number of other things.

- non-professional things -

I live in San Francisco with my husband, [Jim Fingal](https://jimfingal.com), and our rescue bully, Piglet. We're currently working on starting a cool new magazine called the [San Francisco Review of Whatever](https://sfreview.org/) with some of our friends. You can read Elisabeth Nicula, one of those friends, [first describe the idea of the Review in The Back Room](https://www.smallpresstraffic.org/the-back-room-article/a-body-thats-all-surface).

I help out with tech stuff (hardware, software, etc) at [BFF.fm](https://bff.fm/volunteer), a San Francisco community radio station based in the Mission, and regularly volunteer at various community greenspaces around the city—most frequently [Garden for the Environment](https://www.gardenfortheenvironment.org/volunteer) and [the native plant nursery at Sutro Stewards](https://www.sutrostewards.org/volunteer). They're all wonderful places and communities; come to a volunteer day if you'd like to learn more!

I co-founded and helped run [Logic Magazine](https://logicmag.io), on which I continue on the board; and have been running a [small forum I built](https://github.com/hartsick/ruBB/) and, more recently, a [Mastodon instance](https://void.holdings) for friends.

- contact -

I exist a few other places:
* email: christa (dot) hartsock (at) gmail (dot) com
* on the fediverse at 
    * <a rel="me" href="https://void.holdings/@christa">void.holdings (my main account)</a>
    * <a rel="me" href="https://friend.camp/@christa">friend.camp (my secondary account that mostly posts local to the friend camp instance)</a>
    * [bookwyrm (federated, non-corporate goodreads)](https://bookwyrm.social/user/christa)
* [github](https://github.com/hartsick)
* [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/chartsock)
* offline, mostly in San Francisco

If you'd like to talk, shoot me a message via email. I'm often slow at responding, but do have the best intentions. Short, direct asks usually get a response more quickly.

Thanks for visiting; here is a gift:
