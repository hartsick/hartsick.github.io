# christa.town

The code for the [personal site and blog of me, Christa Hartsock,](https://christa.town) built with Jekyll and served via Github Pages.

This is just a public repo because I wanted to play with Github Pages and you have to pay to have Github Pages with a private repo. Maybe you'll find it useful, though!

## Notes to self

### Using the static site generator

Do this the first time:

```
bundle install
```

Do this every time:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Making a page

Make a new file in the directory root, eg `<desired-path>.markdown`. For pages within directories place them in that directory, eg `resources/sf-green-volunteering.markdown`

### Making a blog post

Make a new file in `./_posts` in format YYYY-MM-DD-this-is-a-title.md. Put contents in it. Consider editing it. Commit and push.
